        I am a former ESL teacher who has recently made the switch to web
        development. You could say that I am passionate about all languages, no
        matter if they are spoken languages or coding languages. I have chosen
        such a different career path not only for this reason but also because
        of my long-standing interest in programming and new technologies. I
        recently graduated from the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at
        Concordia University, and I'm now looking for my next opportunity in the
        industry. I am originally from Ville-Marie (the one in
        Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue), but I recently moved to Montreal and I am
        available for work there or remotely.
