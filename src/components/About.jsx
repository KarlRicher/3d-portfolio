        Greetings! I am an experienced ESL teacher who has recently embarked on
        an exciting journey into the world of web development. My fascination
        with languages, whether spoken or in coding, has been the driving force
        behind my career transition. Alongside this passion, my enduring
        curiosity for programming and emerging technologies has led me to this
        new path. I recently completed the rigorous Full-Stack Web Development
        Bootcamp at Concordia University, equipping me with a diverse skill set.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Originally hailing from Ville-Marie in Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue, I
        have recently relocated to the vibrant city of Montreal, where I am
        eagerly seeking my next opportunity in the web development industry. My
        adaptability allows me to work seamlessly both in Montreal and remotely,
        granting me the flexibility to collaborate effectively wherever the
        opportunity arises.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills to innovative
        projects and joining a dynamic team. Let's connect and explore how my
        passion for languages and technology can add value to your organization!
